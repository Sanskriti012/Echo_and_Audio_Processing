# Echo_and_Audio_Processing
# Problem statement
A rock band is playing at the Open Air Theatre in New SAC. The band stands in the
front of the stage. Each of the stage walls contributes to a 70% echo in the sound
produced. The distance of the back wall from the center of the stage is 17.15 meters.
And the distance of the sidewalls is 8.575 meters. The speed of sound is 343metres/s.
A recorder is placed near the band to record the audio. The band plays the audio clip
below (Audio1).
a. Open the wav file in MATLAB. What is the sampling frequency? What are the
units? What is the sampling frequency in Hz? Listen to the audio in MATLAB using
the ‘sound’ command
b. Due to the echo from the walls, the signal recorded by the recorder is given by
y[n] = x[n] + A1 ∗ x[n − N1] + A2 ∗ x[n − N2] + A3 ∗ x[n − N3] What are the values
of A1, A2, A3 and N1, N2, N3? Can you generate the signal generated by the recorder?
c. What is the system response of this system? Is it possible to remove the echo from
the signal?
d. Given the audio clip with echo (Audio2). Plot the autocorrelation functions for
Audio1 and Audio2 separately. Observe the peaks in each case. Can you spot the echo
in the plot for Audio 2? What time index does it correspond to?
